        <h2>Our Mission: TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE TO THE MEN AND WOMEN OF 2ND BATTALION, 5TH MARINES AND THEIR FAMILIES</h2>
        <h3>TEAM 2/5 RSM</h3>
        <p>
          We are a group of citizens of Rancho Santa Margarita who want to show gratitude and provide support to the courageous young men and women of our City's adopted 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines. Throughout history, the Marines have answered calls to defend, protect and serve always putting their mission ahead of themselves as individuals. We are grateful and want to do something to express our appreciation and gratitude. We choose to provide assistance and support to the Marines of the 2/5 and their families.
